//! UI boundary types and capability surface for Semantic desktop applications.
//!
//! This crate owns the UI operation identity, capability taxonomy, and
//! admitted boundary types for the first-wave UI application boundary track.
//!
//! # Current Wave Status
//!
//! Wave 0 scaffolding only. All types are inert markers. Executable admission,
//! runtime session ownership, and drawing surface are deferred to Wave 1+.
//!
//! # Non-Commitments
//!
//! This crate does not claim:
//! - a general widget/layout framework
//! - multi-window, browser, or mobile UI support
//! - a forked graphics stack or shader-language ownership
//! - that UI support is already part of the published `v1.1.1` line
