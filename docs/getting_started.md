# Getting Started

Status: current-main onboarding guide for the current public toolchain surface

## Purpose

This guide gives an external engineer the shortest honest path from clone to:

- building the public CLI entrypoints
- checking and running a minimal program
- compiling and verifying a `.smc` artifact
- running one canonical example from the current readiness contour

This is an onboarding guide, not a release-promotion document. Current `main`
includes landed work beyond the published stable line, so release reading still
follows the status model in `docs/roadmap/public_status_model.md`.

## Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain installed
- repository cloned locally
- commands run from repository root

## Build The Public Entry Points

```powershell
cargo build --bin smc --bin svm
```

## Minimal Source Loop

Create a minimal source file:

```powershell
@'
fn main() {
    return;
}
'@ | Set-Content program.sm
```

Check the source:

```powershell
cargo run --bin smc -- check program.sm
```

Run the source directly:

```powershell
cargo run --bin smc -- run program.sm
```

Compile to SemCode:

```powershell
cargo run --bin smc -- compile program.sm -o program.smc
```

Verify the compiled artifact:

```powershell
cargo run --bin smc -- verify program.smc
```

Run the verified `.smc` artifact:

```powershell
cargo run --bin smc -- run-smc program.smc
```

Disassemble the compiled artifact:

```powershell
cargo run --bin svm -- disasm program.smc
```

## Canonical Example Loop

The current curated examples pack lives in:

- `examples/canonical/`

Start with:

- `examples/canonical/cli_batch_core/src/main.sm`

Check it:

```powershell
cargo run --bin smc -- check examples/canonical/cli_batch_core/src/main.sm
```

Run it:

```powershell
cargo run --bin smc -- run examples/canonical/cli_batch_core/src/main.sm
```

Compile and verify it:

```powershell
cargo run --bin smc -- compile examples/canonical/cli_batch_core/src/main.sm -o cli_batch_core.smc
cargo run --bin smc -- verify cli_batch_core.smc
```

If you want a broader tour of the curated pack, see `docs/examples_index.md`.

## Current Public CLI References

For the current admitted CLI surface, see:

- `docs/spec/cli.md`

For the canonical spec bundle, start at:

- `docs/spec/index.md`

## Validation

Useful repository-level checks during onboarding:

```powershell
cargo test -q
cargo test -q --test public_api_contracts
cargo test -q --test canonical_examples
```

## Boundary Reminder

The canonical examples pack includes one honest boundary example:

- `examples/canonical/boundary_alias_import/`

It exists to show a real current limit, not a supported workflow.
