# Semantic Core Spec Bundle

Status: draft v0

This directory is the canonical specification bundle for the current core
execution contract.

Current documents in this PR:

- `syntax.md` - canonical Rust-like source syntax contract
- `types.md` - source-level type contract and current type-family limits
- `semcode.md` - SemCode binary contract and compatibility rules
- `profile.md` - `ParserProfile` policy contract
- `verifier.md` - SemCode admission verification contract
- `vm.md` - Semantic VM public execution contract
- `quotas.md` - runtime quota taxonomy and enforcement contract
- `abi.md` - PROMETHEUS host ABI boundary contract
- `capabilities.md` - capability manifest and denial contract
- `gates.md` - gate registry and binding contract
- `runtime.md` - runtime orchestration session contract
- `state.md` - semantic state model and invariants
- `rules.md` - deterministic rule and agenda contract
- `audit.md` - audit trail and replay metadata contract

Adjacent source-surface documents also remain relevant:

- `docs/imports.md`
- `docs/exports.md`
- `docs/LANGUAGE.md`

Later PRs may extend this bundle further with richer module, package, CLI,
versioning, and release-facing validation specifications.

Contract precedence:

1. `docs/spec/*` defines the public contract.
2. Code must implement that contract.
3. Architecture and roadmap documents constrain ownership and sequencing around
   that contract.

Blocking rule:

- any public change to SemCode admission, VM execution, quota semantics, or
  `ParserProfile` policy must update the relevant file in this directory in the
  same change series.
