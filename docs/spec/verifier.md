# Verifier Specification

Status: draft v0
Admission owner: `sm-verify`

## Purpose

This document defines the current SemCode admission contract before standard VM
execution.

The verifier is a public admission layer.
It is not an internal VM detail and it is not an optimizer.

## Public Surface

Current verifier surface is centered on:

- `verify_semcode`
- `VerifiedProgram`
- `VerifiedFunction`
- `RejectReport`

## Verification Scope

Current SemCode verification checks include:

- header validity
- supported version validity
- function and section integrity
- opcode validity
- operand shape validity
- jump-target validity
- string and debug reference validity
- register-budget validity
- call-target validity
- capability consistency with actual opcode usage

Current ownership-specific structural checks for `SEMCOD11` include:

- `OWN0` section presence and layout validity when ownership transport is used
- admitted ownership event kind validity
- tuple-only `AccessPath` payload validity
- header/capability consistency for ownership transport

## Contract Rule

Standard execution uses the chain:

`emit SemCode -> verify_semcode -> execute`

Important rule:

- VM execution does not replace SemCode admission
- a valid producer path does not waive verifier admission

## Separation Rule

`sm-verify` must not become:

- a source parser
- a semantic runtime
- a VM executor
- a general optimizer

It is allowed to reject malformed or contract-inconsistent bytecode only.

Current ownership rule:

- verifier admits ownership payload structurally only
- verifier does not evaluate borrow overlap, release timing, or runtime alias
  policy

## Reject Model

Verifier rejection must preserve:

- the failing verification code
- enough function or offset context to debug the failure
- deterministic diagnostics for the same input artifact

## Verified Execution Rule

The standard `.smc` execution route must require `sm-verify` admission.

Helpers that bypass verification may exist for lower-level testing, but they
must not redefine the public execution contract.

## Review Rule

Changes to the verifier require review if they alter:

- what SemCode is considered admissible
- the meaning of an existing verification code
- the structure or deterministic order of reject diagnostics

Required follow-up:

1. update this specification
2. update verifier tests
3. update compatibility or golden tests if public behavior changed
