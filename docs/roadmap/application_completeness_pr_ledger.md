# Semantic Application Completeness PR Ledger

Status: proposed explicit post-readiness expansion program

Read this document using the canonical status vocabulary in:

- `docs/roadmap/public_status_model.md`

Read this document together with:

- `docs/roadmap/final_readiness_verdict.md`
- `docs/roadmap/v1_readiness.md`
- `reports/g1_release_scope_statement.md`

## Purpose

This ledger defines the next honest expansion program after the completed
readiness cycle.

Its purpose is to make Semantic capable of authoring and validating
benchmark-class application experiments such as a self-learning snake.

This ledger is not:

- a claim that Semantic is already `public release`
- a silent widening of the current qualified contour
- a promise that browser UI becomes part of the language boundary

## Target Outcome

After the base-path PRs in this ledger land, the repository should be able to
support all of the following as real Semantic programs:

- a deterministic headless snake engine
- a training loop over that engine using a seeded pseudo-random source
- a policy/Q-table update loop over admitted collections and scalar operators
- a text trace or frame stream suitable for external inspection

The required benchmark family is:

- `examples/benchmarks/snake_core.sm`
- `examples/benchmarks/snake_learning.sm`
- `examples/benchmarks/snake_trace.sm`

The base path does **not** require:

- browser DOM ownership
- HTML/CSS as part of the language boundary
- a widget toolkit
- multi-window UI

An external HTML/TypeScript renderer may still be used as an adapter on top of
the experiment trace.

## Current Verified Baseline On `main`

Current `main` already admits these benchmark-relevant surfaces:

- enum declarations and enum-pattern `match`
- `text` literals, `text` type positions, and same-family text equality
- `Sequence(T)` declared types, literals, indexing, equality, and `for value in sequence`
- `len(sequence) -> i32` (landed PR #387)
- `is_empty(sequence) -> bool` (landed PR #395)
- `contains(sequence, value) -> bool` (landed PR #396)
- `push(sequence, value) -> Sequence(T)` (landed PR #397)
- `prepend(sequence, value) -> Sequence(T)` (landed PR #397)
- `pop(sequence) -> Sequence(T)` (landed PR #398)
- first-class closures with immutable capture
- the separate desktop UI boundary as a landed post-stable track

Current `main` still fails this benchmark family at the following points:

- public integer arithmetic as a normal `i32` / `u32` application surface
- `let mut`
- plain reassignment
- statement `while`
- statement `loop` with bare `break;` and `continue`
- `Sequence(T)` utility layer: `len(sequence) -> i32`, `is_empty(sequence) -> bool`, `contains(sequence, value) -> bool`, `push(sequence, value) -> Sequence(T)`, `prepend(sequence, value) -> Sequence(T)`, and `pop(sequence) -> Sequence(T)`
- a first-wave map/dictionary family for Q-tables and visit counts
- a deterministic seeded pseudo-random source
- text concatenation / minimal formatting for traces
- a narrow admitted stdout experiment surface

## Program Rules

- one PR = one logical step
- every behavioral PR must ship tests
- every docs/spec/runtime surface change must move together
- no silent widening of `published stable` or the current qualified contour
- merge only on green local validation where applicable and green GitHub CI
- keep one active expansion stream at a time

## Contingency Slots

- `PR-CONT-1` [contingency]

    pack
  Title:

- `PR-CONT-2` [contingency]
  Trigger:
  - open only if a visual native demo is required after the headless benchmark
    pack is already green
  Title:
  - `examples/ui: add desktop snake demo over the existing UI boundary`

## Exit Condition

This program is complete only when:

- the snake benchmark pack is green on the admitted Semantic surface
- the trace/export story is explicit
- the benchmark does not depend on hidden author-only workarounds
- browser rendering, if used, remains an external adapter rather than an
  implicit language boundary
